Users in a mobile app need to be able to private invite friends to a page on a website.

Private message won't work because the app needs to know who was invited.

So, my belief is that we have to select friends from a list and then "invite them to our fb app" which would in turn redirect them to the url.

or have them click something which takes them to the url.
